# Hello World!, I'm Roxana Cruz!

Welcome to my cool corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate tech enthusiast and a creative soul on a mission to make the world a better place through code! 🌟


## Hi! im Roxy. This is a little about me and what I do

- 🖥️ **Dev** | Crafting beautiful and intuitive user experiences. My ultimate career goal is to build a career in Computer Science, focusing on artificial intelligence and cloud computing, with the dream of working at a leading software company.
- 🌍 **Values** | Growing up in a marginalized community, I didn’t have as much support from my parents as most Latino families suffer from financial and educational barriers. I didn’t have many conversations with people in tech jobs or high positions. It was tough to find someone of my status who achieved a career and, on top of that, a woman. Which is why I strongly believe that a student's career and educational success are determined by how much they push themselves to get out of their comfort zone. As a first-generation college student, I noticed how important it is to leverage my passions for education, technology, and social justice by participating in programs that help the community and build that bridge to higher education.
- 🎓 **Academics** | I am vice president of the Society of Hispanic Engineers. As the youngest member on the board, I’m excited to bring fresh ideas and energy to the team. I’ve always considered myself a resilient and determined person, I am a student who works hard, to excel in my studies, and pursue a brighter future. I am an LA-Tech X Microsoft X Waymo IT Tech Career Academy student. and prev SWE intern at Salesforce
